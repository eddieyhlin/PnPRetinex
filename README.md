# PnPRetinex

This matlab pseudo code is for "Low-Light Enhancement Using a Plug-and-Play Retinex Model with Shrinkage Mapping for Illumination Estimation"

### Requirements
* Matlab R2016a

### Usage
1. Put the test image in `data` directory. The images in the directory are from these sources. 
* LIME: Guo, Xiaojie, Yu Li, and Haibin Ling. "LIME: Low-light image enhancement via illumination map estimation." IEEE Transactions on image processing 26.2 (2016): 982-993.
* NPE: Wang, Shuhang, et al. "Naturalness preserved enhancement algorithm for non-uniform illumination images." IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 22.9 (2013): 3538-3548.
* NASA: https://dragon.larc.nasa.gov/retinex/pao/news/
2. Run 'demo.m'.
3. Results will be generated in the `output` directory.
